# Intro

For this assignment, I've decided to go with react, to catch up and remember how things work in this framework. At first I was a little bit lost, although, I think it turned out really well.

## Some things I've struggled with:

1. Responsive design (I always struggle with it, nothing new)
2. Importing own components css into it (I had to use a global.css file)
3. Testing (I tried to do some, but it did not turn out well)
4. Animations (I could only manage to set the ones at the beginning of the project)

## Available Scripts

In order to start the project, run the following scripts inside the project directory:

First, install all the dependencies
### `npm install`

Then, run the app in the development mode.\
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
